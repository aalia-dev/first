<!--Here there are two process 
add(staged)
commit(unchanged)

1.cd filename
2.git status:
Gives us the status of all the tracking and changes happening 

M means: modified

There are 4 stages:

unTracked:new files that git doesnt yet track or have not been added or committed
modified:changed
staged:file ready to be committed
unmodified:unchanged -commit

add and commit:

add:adds new or changed files in our working directory to the Git staging area. 
git add<filename>

commit:it is the record of change
git commit-m"meaninful message"

For adding entirely use git add .

Now this will show main branch in local is one step ahead, so to make the changes in github also we should do push command

git push:
Upload local repo content to remote repo 
git push origin main

Here the "origin" is remote ; where all the remote repositories are present and default file (the one used for copyinh) from there is being cloned in our local system so the changes now made are pushed to origin(remote) "main" as in main branch

Note:Everyone of us start coding in our local system so to add that from initial the below method is followed.

To make new folder:
cd .. : to move to the root file
mkdir foldername or filename: This is make directory

so to get .git file we should actually do 

git init:used to create a new git repo

<!--Here there are two process 
add(staged)
commit(unchanged)

1.cd filename
2.git status:
Gives us the status of all the tracking and changes happening 

M means: modified

There are 4 stages:

unTracked:new files that git doesnt yet track or have not been added or committed
modified:changed
staged:file ready to be committed
unmodified:unchanged -commit

add and commit:

add:adds new or changed files in our working directory to the Git staging area. 
git add<filename>

commit:it is the record of change
git commit-m"meaninful message"

For adding entirely use git add .

Now this will show main branch in local is one step ahead, so to make the changes in github also we should do push command

git push:
Upload local repo content to remote repo 
git push origin main

Here the "origin" is remote ; where all the remote repositories are present and default file (the one used for copyinh) from there is being cloned in our local system so the changes now made are pushed to origin(remote) "main" as in main branch

Note:Everyone of us start coding in our local system so to add that from initial the below method is followed.

To make new folder:
cd .. : to move to the root file
mkdir foldername or filename: This is make directory

so to get .git file we should actually do 

git init:used to create a new git repo

git remote add origin<https link>:
    This is used while we are creating our project in our system and using terminal to set the full code in github.This is telling we are going to add in origin which is remote repo ie (github).
    Basically we are intially telling the remote(github)is the origin and all the changes are pushed there
   
 git remote -v: used to verify remote:shows the fetch and push links (both will be same of github https link only)

 git branch:used for checking the which branch we are in.(older version:* master)
 Generally there is a default branch called as master which is different from main branch.Now we can create new branch named main and push all the contents or make the master branch as main by renaming.

 git branch -M main:to rename the branch
 git push -u origin main :used for telling (-u: set upstream) we are goint to commit in main branch only so -u prevents us from writing the same thing again now we can use just git push.

<!--Here there are two process 
add(staged)
commit(unchanged)

1.cd filename
2.git status:
Gives us the status of all the tracking and changes happening 

M means: modified

There are 4 stages:

unTracked:new files that git doesnt yet track or have not been added or committed
modified:changed
staged:file ready to be committed
unmodified:unchanged -commit

add and commit:

add:adds new or changed files in our working directory to the Git staging area. 
git add<filename>

commit:it is the record of change
git commit-m"meaninful message"

For adding entirely use git add .

Now this will show main branch in local is one step ahead, so to make the changes in github also we should do push command

git push:
Upload local repo content to remote repo 
git push origin main
-->
<p>Hello</p>

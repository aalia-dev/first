<!--Here there are two process 
add(staged)
commit(unchanged)

1.cd filename
2.git status:
Gives us the status of all the tracking and changes happening 

M means: modified

There are 4 stages:

unTracked:new files that git doesnt yet track or have not been added or committed
modified:changed
staged:file ready to be committed
unmodified:unchanged -commit

add and commit:

add:adds new or changed files in our working directory to the Git staging area. 
git add<filename>

commit:it is the record of change
git commit-m"meaninful message"

For adding entirely use git add .

Now this will show main branch in local is one step ahead, so to make the changes in github also we should do push command

git push:
Upload local repo content to remote repo 
git push origin main

Here the "origin" is remote ; where all the remote repositories are present and default file (the one used for copyinh) from there is being cloned in our local system so the changes now made are pushed to origin(remote) "main" as in main branch

Note:Everyone of us start coding in our local system so to add that from initial the below method is followed.

To make new folder:
cd .. : to move to the root file
mkdir foldername or filename: This is make directory

so to get .git file we should actually do 

git init:used to create a new git repo

git remote add origin<https link>:
    This is used while we are creating our project in our system and using terminal to set the full code in github.This is telling we are going to add in origin which is remote repo ie (github).
    Basically we are intially telling the remote(github)is the origin and all the changes are pushed there
   
 git remote -v: used to verify remote:shows the fetch and push links (both will be same of github https link only)

 git branch:used for checking the which branch we are in.(older version:* (the star tells which branch we are in )master)
 Generally there is a default branch called as master which is different from main branch.Now we can create new branch named main and push all the contents or make the master branch as main by renaming.

 git branch -M main:to rename the branch
 git push -u origin main :used for telling (-u: set upstream) we are goint to commit in main branch only so -u prevents us from writing the same thing again now we can use just git push.

Preferred method:Creating the project on github and cloning on our local system is easy

GIT BRANCHES:

git branch:To verify which branch
git branch -M main(modifiedname): To rename the branch 
git checkout <branchname>: to navigate to that branch
git checkout -b<new branchname>:to create new branch
git branch -d<branch name> :to delete the branch 
Note:We cannot delete the branch being on the same branch so first we should navigate to different branch then we can delete     

Work flow:

So there will be seperate branches as we saw and each team will be working on different features or ideas
so this should be merged. 

Way 1:
git diff <branchname>:to compare commits, branches, files
git merge< branch name>:To merge 2 branches

Way 2:
Create a PR:Pull Request on github
This will have effect only on the github 
git pull origin main:used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match the content

Resolving merge conflicts:
Git is not able to decide which changes to add when 2 or more branches make changes on the same line. 

So either we can use the commands given or we can just remove the lines or add them both and the new one will be added in next line.Then use checkout and add,commit and push them

Undoing changes:
Case 1:Staged changes(ready to be committed)
git reset<filename>
git reset(for all)
This will move back to unchanged stage just before add

Case 2: Committed changes(for one commit)
git reset HEAD~1; means it has been committed but that needs to be brought back to unchanged stage.

This is like a linked list and the last code is latest and HEAD so by git reset HEAD~1; we are basically bringing the head to the previous unstaged position and the newest head (committed) will be deleted

git log:Used to check all the logs(history) of what is happening. 
q: is used for quitting from the particular command

Case 3:Committed changes (for many commits)
git reset<commit hash>
git reset --hard<commit hash(hashcode)>

So in this the head should be moved to backwards so the hash of the changes are used(that can be fetched using git log)

git reset --hard<hashcode>: used for deleting the content in vs code also or any code editor

Fork:
used to create a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original upstream repository.

In simple words if we want to copy the code of another git file we use fork.
Fork is a rough copy. In companies the bugs of another developers are fixed so we need a copy of the developer's code so we fork it.

Fork is a copy of a repository made on GitHub so that we can work on someone else’s code without affecting the original repository. It is mainly used when we do not have write access, such as in open-source projects.

origin

Points to your fork

upstream

(Optional) points to the original repository
